## FRED Robot - 3D parts description

Figure 1 shows the 3D models of FRED rendered in TinkerCad. Item (1) shows the 3D part of FRED's head. Item (2) shows the cover of the back of the head. Item (3) is the robot's chest. The version in the image is equivalent to the chest of the female version made to receive the pink heart. Item (4) shows the cover of the back of the chest. Item (5) shows the shoulder that must be screwed to the chest. Items (6) and (7) are, respectively, the arm and articulated hand of the robot. There is no difference between the shoulders, arms and left and right hands. Items (8) and (9) are the right and left feet. It is important to note that there is a difference between the left and right foot models. In (10) you can see two pieces of the robot's legs. These pieces use the same model, with no difference between the left and right legs. In (11) you can see the model of FRED's glasses. And finally, in item (12) you can see the model of the female glasses and the 3D heart piece that can be fitted to the female chest model.

It is important to note that in this directory there are two head models (FRED and Frida) that differ only in the size of the ears and there are two chest models (FRED and Frida). There is also a model for the 3D piece used on the female head to attach Frida's bows.
